Product: Interbase DataPump 
Author: Alexandre Poloziouk
Version: 3.5s3

PLEASE _STRICTLY_ FOLLOW INSTALLATION STEPS:

1. You MUST have all latest updates for Delphi and Interbase Express Library (IBX) installed.
   Visit www.borland.com for more informations regarding updates.

2. Install ccIBPumpVCL
  ccIBPumpVCL library include TccTreeView, TccSpinEdit and TccButonEdit components.
  - run Delphi then open and install ccIBPumpVCL5.dpk (Delphi 5), ccIBPumpVCL6.dpk (Delphi 6)
    or ccIBPumpVCL7.dpk (Delphi 7)
  - go to Delphi Environment Options dialog and add path to ccIBPumpVCL to Library paths

3. The current version of IBPump utilizes the non-free library Clever Internet Suite for displaying the news line.
  This is a drawback, and we suggest the task of changing the program so that it does the same job without the non-free library.
  Optionally, you can disable this library by commenting the CCNEWS compiler conditional define within the ccGetVer.inc file.

  For compiling the IBPump with Clever Internet Suite, download and install the Clever Internet Suite library using the link below:
  https://www.clevercomponents.com/downloads/inetsuite/suitedownload.asp

4. Compile IBDataPump
  - first you need to fix some bugs in Borland ADODB.pas 
  - copy ADODB.pas from $(DELPHI)\Source\Vcl\ to the same directory with IBPump.dpr and IBPumpPlug.dpr (IBDataPump by default)
  - find following code and add line to fix known problem with Required attributes 
  
    { Determine if the field's property list contains an ISAUTOINCREMENT entry }
    procedure AddFieldDef(F: Field; FieldDefs: TFieldDefs);
    var
      FieldType: TFieldType;
      FieldDef: TFieldDef;
      I: Integer;
      FName: string;
      FSize: Integer;
      FPrecision: Integer;
    begin
      FieldType := ADOTypeToFieldType(F.Type_, EnableBCD);
      if FieldType <> ftUnknown then
      begin
        FSize := 0;
        FPrecision := 0;
        FieldDef := FieldDefs.AddFieldDef;
  
        // ****Bug Fix A. Schmidt 23.10.2001****
        FieldDef.Required := (F.Attributes and adFldIsNullable)=0;
  - find following line:
      if TagVariant(IndexInfo.Fields[SOrdinalPosition].Value).ulVal > 1 then
    and replace it with:
      if IndexDefs.IndexOf(VarToStr(IndexInfo.Fields[SIndexName].Value)) <> -1 then // ****Bug Fix Troy Wolbrink  01.11.2001****

  - now you can open and compile IBPump.dpr and IBPumpPlug.dpr projects

    Please note that all versions of Delphi 5 and Delphi 6 are supported.

5. IMPORTANT : Please remember that all Interbase DataPump forms and modules 
   contains links to ibpDM.pas module and you will have to open ibpDM module 
   first before compile or change anything.

6. Read END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (EULA.txt) before start using this software.

  - dynamic creation of the cc components so it compiles with a standard D7 (no need to install the components);
  - correction of the qryFree SQL;
  - the qryFree is created dynamically. Other query and IBSql could be created dynamically to clean up the dfm;
  - minor adjustments of layout (buttons too close from edges...).
